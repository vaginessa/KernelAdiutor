Use Mod Kernel adiutor app to better support the kernel, If you are not using Mod Kernel adiutor by BHB27 Download it on the XDA thread. This will work on any CM Custom ROM that is up to date to CM repo, today they are (CM, Mokee and RR) Be aware Mokee has its separate zip on lollipop, Marshmallow zip will work on any custom ROM.",
