			" Add a interface to Enable/Disable CRC can be enable disable via Kernel auditor, recommend to leave enable.",
			" Simple_ondemand GPU governor  Fix and improves",
			" Update and merge intellithermal to the kernel so it can use all the thermal tool's made by moto/linux for default MSM Thermal and moto blobs and keep the user friendly tools from intellithermal that allow the user to controlo thermal.",
			" CPU, Indle, GPU, sched and Load average Fix's and improves this pack generally improves the way the kernel handle work load.",
